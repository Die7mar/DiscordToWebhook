# DiscordToWebhook
Send webhooks with Discord. I have the problem I have a IPv4 light stack, it means the provider shared the IPv4 adress. So I canÂ´t open ports. \
So I use a Discord bot tosend a webhook to my local home assistent.
The home assistent take the request and aktivate a automation. Example you can find in the Example folder.
